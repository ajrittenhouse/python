Welcome to the Introduction to Python Final Project of Andrew (AJ) Rittenhouse and Corbin White.

The game is called "Lixor" and it is a survival based game. You must move a character around the screen and collect items to score points and stay alive. If you run out of food, the game ends.

Stars are worth 5 points.
Food (bread) is worth 1 point and resets your health meter.
